      <h1> Response to J.R. Carpenter's "A Handmade Web"</h1>
        <p style="font-family:monospace;"> <p style="line-height: 2;">This article clarified my unconscious desire to create a digital space that is considered not just art but also a personal, creative, informative, and intimate environment. Before starting this class, I looked up to the websites that were created by content manangement systems because they looked so modern and put together. However, this class/this article gave me a greater appreciation for handmde websites. I'm guessing handmade webs can irk people sometimes because they are a constant work in progress, but there is beauty to that. These handmade websites have the capability to reflect the aging and evolution of one's own life which I believe is an underappreciated oppurtunity.
