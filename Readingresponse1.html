      <h1> Response to J.R. Carpenter's "A Handmade Web"</h1>
        <p style="font-family:monospace;"> <p style="line-height: 2;">This article clarified my unconscious desire to create a digital space that is considered not just art but also a personal, creative, informative, and intimate environment. Before starting this class, I looked up to the websites that were created by content manangement systems because they looked so modern and put together. However, this class/this article gave me a greater appreciation for handmde websites. I'm guessing handmade webs can irk people sometimes because they are a constant work in progress, but there is beauty to that. These handmade websites have the capability to reflect the aging and evolution of one's own life which I believe is an underappreciated oppurtunity.

<h1>Response to Callum Copley's "New Document 1"</h1>
<p><p style="line-height: 2;">I thought this was a really cool reading because it contained a lot of depth. There was so much information within this article, almost as if it could be a scholarly article or essay, but the authors presented the information in a really creative and representative way. I liked how within each section of the reading, little messages came up in the sections to let me know what new information has popped up. It is reminicent of text messages and IM which is relevant with the meaning of the article. This reading also made me realize a lot of things regarding the influence and power of technology and online writing on business and relationships. There are many business apps that incorporate social connecting. Technology is allowing different spheres and platforms to have socializing capabilities even though they may not be totally necessary for every purpose. Technology has also created a different kind of addiction. I thought the part about the "pulsating elipses" was interesting because it is true. There is so much meaning embedded within the three dots. So much anticipation, excitement, tension. There is now new complexity and depth within simple words all due to social media and technology. The dynamics of texting is also quite fascinating. There are pauses, emotions, emphasis, tone, all which are similar to an in person conversation. But just like real life there are ways to stop talking to someone. You can leave someone on read, you can block them, leave the groupchat, leave the facetime. In real life you just walk away, and close your mouth. I guess this is obvious observation but stopping talking to someone over text or whatever platform carries more meaning than stopping in real life. For some reason people seem to care about talking to people more in technology. It is interesting how this all developed but scary about how much it is changing human relationships.

    <h1>Response to Frank Chimero's "The Good Room"</h1>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this reading because it addressed essential practices that need to become more prevalent in the virtual world. He brought up ideas I haven't given thought to before. I always thought of web commercialization as a fact. It is there, it will always be there, why bother about it. Sure, it is annoying, but isn't it just a truth about being online? This was my mindset before reading The Good Room. Chimero is right though. Why can't the web be a quiet, meditative, creative space in conjunction with being a virtual commonwealth? Technology is already reflecting more and more everyday the physical world so why not take it one step further. Just like in real life, there are opportunities to socialize, share, meditate, conduct business, study, just like on the internet. However, in both worlds, meditation and quiet introspection is lacking. We are being overly stimulated everywhere we go. If you live in the city or a bustling town you will look at your phone and you will be bombarded with ads and promos. You look up from your phone and then billboards, posters, logos, people throwing flyers in your hands, flashy marketing is thrown in your face. You go home, and turn on netflix. Reccomendations based on your interests suffocate you while you try to find a show you want to watch. You cannot escape. The world of technology and the world we physically reside in are interconnected. They are no longer seperate entities where we can choose to escape from. They all reflect each other. So why not reform, recreate, and reflect? Why not create a space online where people can rest for a bit, and take in some culture, ideas, and artistic visualizations. This article created a lot of questions for me, all positive, because this idea of creating an online room free of commercialization sounds fascinating to me. Now that I have the capability to create a website, I realize I have the power to do what the author is wishing people would do, create a space for soul.
